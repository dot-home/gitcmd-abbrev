#   git-authors - display all commit authors in a log, with commit counts
#
#   This uses `git log`, so the counts will be displayed for all commits up
#   to the current HEAD. However, it passes any parameters you give on to
#   `git log` so you can count any arbitrary selection of commits (e.g.,
#   `git-authors origin/main`). This of course also allows you to add
#   options that don't display the Author: line, such as --oneline, which
#   will result in no output.
#
#   The output is displayed in descending order of commit count; you can
#   pipe it into `sort -k 2` to sort by author name.
